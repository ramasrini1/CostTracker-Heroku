    <div  class= "box2 mt-4">
    <p>Have you gone on a trip with your friends and wondered how to split the 
    cost of the total travel expenses? The Cost Tracker app will help you split 
    the cost and make the payments to the individual bank accounts. 
    </p>
    
    <p>This web app will provide an interface for each individual in the group to 
    enter their cost and (Event)trip name. An algorithm will be used to determine the amount 
    that each individual will contribute. And a payment request or money will be sent to 
    each userâ€™s venmo account using the venmo api through the Cost Tracker App. 
    A user gets money deposited or gets a request payment depending 
    upon their contribution to the trip.
  </p>
  <p>The money transaction as of now is only handled by the admin. 
  The users of the app just need to enter their expenses for the trip and their 
  expenses will be settled by the admin.
